# Project Name
Horiseon: Social Media Marketing Done Right

## Project Description
In this project, we were asked to refractor the code to be more accessible for people with disabilities.  To achieve this, I changed any non-semantic elements (i.e. div and span) into semantic elements, which are more descriptive.  Because it is also important for developers to "leave the code cleaner than when we got it", I added comments that explain the purpose and content of each section of code in the HTML file and the CSS file.
