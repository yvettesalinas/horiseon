# 📛 Project Name and Purpose
Horiseon: Social Media Marketing Done Right

In this project, we were asked to refractor the code to be more accessible for people with disabilities.  To achieve this, I changed any non-semantic elements (i.e. div and span) into semantic elements, which are more descriptive.  Because it is also important for developers to "leave the code cleaner than when we got it", I added comments that explain the purpose and content of each section of code in the HTML file and the CSS file. 

## 💡 Acceptance Criteria
* It is done when the source code has semantic elements.

* It is done when image elements have accessible alt attributes. 

* It is done when the title element is concise and descriptive.

* It is done when all links function correctly.

* It is done when the CSS file is properly commented and organized to follow semantic structure.
